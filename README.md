# Django Mini Project Challenge

## 1. Project's Title

Django Celery Integration: Producer-Consumer Communication

## 2. Project Description

This project demonstrates the integration of two Django projects to establish communication between a producer and a consumer via API calls. The producer generates data based on user input, sends it to the consumer asynchronously using Celery, and receives the processed results through a webhook. Key features include the use of RabbitMQ as the message broker, Django REST framework for API endpoints, and django-celery-results for storing Celery task results.

## 5. Setup

To set up this project, you will need to install only Docker and Docker Compose on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Farkito-dev/farkito-hotel-api.git
    ```
2. Change settings Domain name for Producer and Consumer to you local ip address in both projects

3. Build Docker Image and Make Migrations
    ```bash
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations"
    docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py migrate"
    ```
4. generate API key for both application using django shell 

    ```bash
    docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py sh"
    from rest_framework_api_key.models import APIKey
    api_key, key = APIKey.objects.create_key(name="my-remote-service")
    print(api_key, key)

    ```

```

## 8.  Achievements 

1. **Creating Virtual Environments and Installing Packages:**
   - I set up separate virtual environments for each application using Dockerfile.producer and Dockerfile.consumer. Additionally, I created a docker-compose file that manages both services for easier manipulation, addressing some configuration difficulties.

2. **Creating Django Projects and Apps:**
   - I established Django projects and apps for both the producer and consumer. Naming them was flexible, allowing customization.

3. **Creating Models in the Producer Project:**
   - For the producer project, I designed models to represent the data intended for the consumer. Specifically, I created an 'Order' model along with an 'Order Item' model to accurately track order states like 'pending' and 'confirmed.'

4. **Creating API Endpoints in the Producer Project:**
   - I developed API endpoints in the producer project using the Django REST framework. Utilizing model viewsets, I customized serializers and viewsets for creating orders and order items. Authentication and permission classes were implemented to secure access to these endpoints.

5. **Implementing Webhook Receiver in the Producer Project:**
   - I introduced a feature called 'ChangeOrderStatusView' within the producer project, serving as a webhook receiver. Authentication used API keys via 'rest_framework_api_key' for added security.

6. **Creating Celery Tasks in the Consumer Project:**
   - In the consumer project, I crafted Celery tasks designed to process message data and webhook URLs received from the producer. These tasks execute operations such as string concatenation (e.g., currency, order key, and status). The results were stored using 'django-celery-results.'

7. **Creating a View to Trigger Celery Task in the Consumer Project:**
   - A view named 'SendMessageView' was established within the consumer project. It accepts POST requests from the producer, initiating Celery tasks with the provided data. A response, including the task ID, is sent back to the producer.

8. **Exposing Celery Task Results via API in the Consumer Project:**
   - An API endpoint was devised in the consumer project to expose Celery task results. Using Django REST framework, a serializer and viewset were created for the 'TaskResult' model. Authentication and permission classes were implemented to control access to this endpoint.

9. **Creating a Signal Handler in the Consumer Project:**
   - A signal handler was implemented in the consumer project, triggered upon saving a Celery task result in the database. This handler sends the result to the producer's webhook URL using the 'requests' library.

10. **Writing Unit Tests:**
    - Unit tests were developed for both the consumer and producer projects using Djangoâ€™s built-in testing framework.

11. **Running Tests and Manual Endpoint Testing:**
    - Tests were executed to ensure proper functionality in both projects. Additionally, local runs allowed manual testing of API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
